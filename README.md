# Udacity FSND final project : Casting agency By Odai Alsalieti

## Motivation for project

This project is the outcome of what I have learned through this scholarship for Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree program.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects.

Initializing :

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

Activating :

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Export environment virables

Export the environment variables to your local machine by running :

```bash
source setup.sh
```

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/starter/` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Create local database

Create a local database then run Database Migrations :

```bash
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
```

## Running the server

From within the `capstone/` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
